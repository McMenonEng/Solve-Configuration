Fluid,<p>Select <b>Fluid</b> to be used from the list.  &lt;Other&gt; allows you to enter your own density etc. </p>,,,,,
Quantity,<p><b>Quantity</b> of this part required.</p>,,,,,
Pressure,<p>Operating <b>pressure</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating pressure should be used here but the design pressure (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable pressure for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignPressure,<p><b>Design Pressure</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Temperature,<p>Operating <b>temperature</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating temperature should be used here but the design temperature (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable temperature for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignTemperature,<p><b>Design Temperature</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Density,"<p>For <b>fluids</b> that this application is programmed for, the <b><i>density</i></b> will be automatically computed from temperature and pressure</p><p>For user defined fluids the <b><i>operating density</i>, <i>SG</i> or <i>MW </i></b> must be entered.</p>",,,,,
Viscosity,<p>Operating <b>viscosity</b> of a fluid is effectively a measure of its resistance to  flow. </p>,,,,,
ZFactor,"<p><b>Z Factor</b> (compressibility) is required for gases only.</p><p>Selecting user gas means the Z Factor must be entered.</p><p>Z Factor is used to modify the ideal gas law to account for real gas behaviour.</p><p>The effect of Z Factor depends upon the units used for density and flow; please see the Tools menu, Z Factor Effects entry for a fuller explanation of this (ensure you have selected your required units first).</p><p>In the specific case of operating density and actual flow Z Factor has no effect on the DP result calculated; but is useful for converting to normal units.</p>",,,,,
IsentropicIndex,"<p><b>Isentropic Index</b> Also known has the heat capacity ratio, and is the ratio between the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) i.e. Cp/Cv</p>",,,,,
Dimensions,"<p><b>Pipe dimensions</b> are required;  enter the relevant dimensions, or double click in Pipe NB to bring up the Pipe Schedule Wizard.</p> <p>Actual dimensions <b>must</b> be used to ensure accurate calculations and correct installation.</p>",,,,,
FlowRates,"<p><b>Meter Max Flowrate</b> is always required . However, it is strongly advised to also enter values for ""Max Flow"" ""Normal Flow"" ""Minimum Flow"" if available. </p><p>Meter Max is the value to which the transmitter will be ranged (i.e. 20 mA).  If Meter max is not available, calculate a value for Meter max based on Normal/Operating flow divided by 0.70 i.e Normal flow should be approx 70% of Meter Max.</p>",,,,,
SupportDiameter,"<p><b>Support Diameter</b> is the diameter across which the plate is supported.  This is normally the same as the pipe I/D for Raised Face and Full Face flanges.  For RTJ flanges with male rings,  the ring PCD is used. These are automatically filled in.  If no dimension is present or if a non-standard design is required, please enter the actual support diameter, confirm and clarify design</p>",,,,,
ProductCode,"<p>Select FPD150 orifice plate or FPD160  orifice flange assembly, as required</p>",,,,,
DPorBore,"<p>Select how to size the orifice, by <b>DP</b> (pressure drop) <i>or</i> <b>bore</b> (hole size)</p> <p>If you select ""By DP"", you enter the meter max DP value, and the bore is then calculated .</p><p>If you select ""By Bore"", you enter the bore value and the DP value at Meter Max flow is calculated. The latter is useful for back-calculations or where the customer already has a bore size.</p>",,,,,
ResultsUnits,"<p>These units are used for the results display, calculation pages etc and may be amended as required.</p>",,,,,
CalculationType,<p><b>Calculation Type</b><br/>ISO 5167:2003 is the most common standard for Orifice Plates. Other standards exist and some are listed here.  Please select ISO5167:2003 unless your customer requirements or data sheet specify otherwise. </p>,,,,,
