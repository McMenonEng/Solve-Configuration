Beta/Reynolds/Design,([ReynoldsNoAtMeterMax] < 500),FALSE,4,"Reynolds number (meter max flow) must be >= 500 for normal accuracy - Reynolds number is less than the min limit for this product, please check the accuracy of the input data or consider decreasing the line size.",,,,,
Added Req,(COUNT([SelectedItem]{CH/FPD/ADD/REQ}) > 0),TRUE,1,Please provide full detail of the added requirement(s) with enquiry/order.,,,,,
Pressure,"([OperatingPressure]{pressure,OperatingPressureUnits} > 2169700) AND ([SelectedItem]{CH/FPD/TAPPING/TYPE} = 'C1')",FALSE,4,Maximum pressure for Chemical Tee tappings is 20.6 Bar g (300 lbf/in² g).,,,,,
H/D restriction,"([SelectedItem]{CH/FPD/LINE/SIZE} IN ('015','020','025','032','040','050','065','080','090','100','125','150','200','250')) AND ([SelectedItem]{CH/FPD/HD/RATIO} = 'H7')",FALSE,4,H/D 0.7 not available for meters below 300 mm (12 in.) diameter,,,,,
Beta/Reynolds/Design,([ReynoldsNoAtNormal] < 500),FALSE,4,"Reynolds number (normal flow) must be >= 500 for normal accuracy  - Reynolds number is less than the min limit for this product, please check the accuracy of the input data or consider decreasing the line size.",,,,,
DP warning,"(ISNULL([MinimumFlow],-1)<0)",FALSE,1,As no minimum flow has been provided turndown checks will not be completed.,,,,,
DP warning,"[MinimumFlow]{flow,MinimumFlowUnits} < 0.25 * [MeterMaxFlow]{flow, MeterMaxFlowUnits}",FALSE,2,Flow measurement range “Turndown” is greater than 4:1. We recommend that you ensure that any transmitter used with this meter will have sufficient accuracy at your specified Normal and Minimum flowrates.,,,,,
Max Reynolds for All products,([ReynoldsNoAtMeterMax] is not null) AND ([ReynoldsNoAtMeterMax] > 100000000),FALSE,4,"Reynolds number is greater than the limit 100,000,000 for any type of differential pressure flow metering. No other type of flow meter in this software package is suitable for such a condition. Please check the accuracy of the input data, consider decreasing the reynolds number by increasing the line size.",,,,,
DP / transmitter warning,"[DPAtMeterMax]{DP,DPUnits} < 125",FALSE,3,Note: DP is low - check transmitter suitable for these conditions.,,,,,
Design Pressure / Operating Pressure,"(([OperatingPressure]{Pressure,OperatingPressureUnits} > [PipeDesignPressure]{Pressure,PipeDesignPressureUnits}) AND ([UserPipeDesignPressure] = true))",FALSE,3,Pipe design pressure must be greater than operating pressure.,,,,,
Isentropic Index Warning,([IsentropicIndex]<1 OR [IsentropicIndex]>3),FALSE,2,Isentropic index out of normal range.,,,,,
