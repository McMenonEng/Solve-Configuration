CustomerData,<p><b>Customer data</b> appears on quotes and specification sheets.</p>,,,,,
Density,"<p>For <b>fluids</b> that this application is programmed for, the <b><i>density</i></b> will be automatically computed from temperature and pressure</p><p>For user defined fluids the <b><i>operating density</i>, <i>SG</i> or <i>MW</i></b> must be entered.</p>",,,,,
Dimensions,<p><b>Pipe dimensions</b> are required;  enter the relevant dimensions.</p> <p>Nominal dimensions may be used for approximations but actual dimensions must be used to ensure accurate calculations and correct installation.</p>,,,,,
RequiredCalc,<p><b>DP required</b> The pressure drop required over the device;   DP = [upstream pressure - downstream pressure] </p>,,,,,
DrainVent,"<p><b>Drain/Vent</b> A drain hole can be required in wet gas or saturated steam flows in horizontal pipes, small amounts of liquid may collect upstream of the plate.  A vent hole can be required in liquid flows in horizontal pipes, a small quanity of gas or vapour may gather at the to of the pipe upstream of the plate.  By drilling a small hole, these conditions can be reduced. <br/>• Pipe ID must be greated than 100mm for drain/vent hole<br/>• Drain/Vent hole must not be greater than 0.1 x orifice diameter<br/>• Choosing both drain and vent holes is outside of the standard<br/></p>",,,,,
FlowRates,"<p><b>Meter Max Flowrate</b> is always required . However, it is strongly advised to also enter values for ""Max Flow"" ""Normal Flow"" ""Minimum Flow"" if available. </p><p>Meter Max is the value to which the transmitter will be ranged (i.e. 20 mA).  If Meter max is not available, calculate a value for Meter max based on Normal/Operating flow divided by 0.70 i.e Normal flow should be approx 70% of Meter Max.</p><p>See help menu for definition of normal/standard flow conditions.</p>",,,,,
Fluid,<p>Select <b>Fluid</b> to be used from the list.  &lt;Other&gt; allows you to enter your own density etc.  Choice of fluid controls calculations used.</p>,,,,,
FluidCategory,<p>Three different computation types are supported; dependent upon the fluid selected.</p> <p>See Technical Data Sheet for details of flow equations.</p>,,,,,
GasPropertyFactor,<p><b>Gas property factor</b> provides the noise computations with a magnitude adjustment for the gas or vapour in question.  For gases this can be computed from M.W. or entered manually using the override facility; for vapour (mass flow) please provide this value.</p>,,,,,
IsentropicIndex,"<p><b>Isentropic Index</b> Also known has the heat capacity ratio, and is the ratio between the heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and the heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) i.e. Cp/Cv</p>",,,,,
LiquidVapourPressure,"<p><b>Liquid vapour pressure</b>(Optional Input) The pressure at which the substance changes phase, below this pressure the liquid will flash in to vapour.  This is used in determining critical pressure and the noise calculations.</p>",,,,,
PipeFittingsMaterial,<p><b>Pipe</b> the material of the pipe the element will be installed in to; <b>Element</b> the material of the orifice element</p><p>Yield stress information from ASME B31.3-2004</p>,,,,,
Pressure,<p>Operating <b>pressure</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating pressure should be used here but the design pressure should be checked against the maximum allowable pressure for the chosen %Product% model.</p>,,,,,
Quantity,<p><b>Quantity</b> of this part required.</p>,,,,,
ResultsUnits,"<p>These units are used for the results display, calculation pages etc and may be amended as required.</p>",,,,,
Temperature,<p>Operating <b>temperature</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating temperature should be used here but the design temperature should be checked against the maximum allowable temperature for the chosen %Product% model.</p>,,,,,
Viscosity,<p>Operating <b>viscosity</b> is <i>not</i> required for computations but is used to check whether %Product% is suitable (for cP or Poise only).</p>,,,,,
ZFactor,"<p><b>Z Factor</b> (compressibility) is required for gases only.</p><p>Selecting user gas means the Z Factor must be entered.</p><p>Z Factor is used to modify the ideal gas law to account for real gas behaviour.</p><p>The effect of Z Factor depends upon the units used for density and flow; please see the Tools menu, Z Factor Effects entry for a fuller explanation of this (ensure you have selected your required units first).</p><p>In the specific case of operating density and actual flow Z Factor has no effect on the DP result calculated; but is useful for converting to normal units.</p>",,,,,
