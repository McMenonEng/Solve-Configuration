Fluid,<p>Select <b>Fluid</b> to be used from the list. &lt;Other&gt; allows you to enter your own density etc.</p>,,,,,
Quantity,<p><b>Quantity</b> of this part required.</p>,,,,,
Pressure,<p>Operating <b>pressure</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating pressure should be used here but the design pressure (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable pressure for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignPressure,<p><b>Design Pressure</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Temperature,<p>Operating <b>temperature</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating temperature should be used here but the design temperature (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable temperature for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignTemperature,<p><b>Design Temperature</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Density,"<p>For <b>fluids</b> that this application is programmed for, the <b><i>density</i></b> will be automatically computed from temperature and pressure.</p><p>For user defined fluids the <b><i>operating density</i>, <i>SG</i> or <i>MW </i></b> must be entered.</p>",,,,,
Viscosity,<p>Operating <b>viscosity</b> of a fluid is effectively a measure of its resistance to flow.</p>,,,,,
ZFactor,"<p><b>Z Factor</b> (compressibility) is required for gases only.</p><p>Selecting user gas means the Z Factor must be entered.</p><p>Z Factor is used to modify the ideal gas law to account for real gas behaviour.</p><p>The effect of Z Factor depends upon the units used for density and flow; please see the Tools menu, Z Factor Effects entry for a fuller explanation of this (ensure you have selected your required units first).</p><p>In the specific case of operating density and actual flow, Z Factor has no effect on the DP result calculated but is useful for converting to normal units.</p>",,,,,
IsentropicIndex,"<p><b>Isentropic Index</b></br>Also known as the heat capacity ratio, it is the ratio between the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) i.e. Cp/Cv</p>",,,,,
Dimensions,"<p><b>Pipe dimensions</b> are required; enter the relevant dimensions, or click on the Pipe NB button to bring up the pipe schedule wizard.</p><p>Actual dimensions <b>must</b> be used to ensure accurate calculations and correct installation.</p>",,,,,
FlowRates,"<p><b>Meter Max Flowrate</b> is always required. However, it is strongly advised to also enter values for ""Max Flow"", ""Normal Flow"", and, ""Minimum Flow"" if available.</p><p>Meter Max is the value to which the transmitter will be ranged (i.e. 20 mA). If Meter Max is not available, calculate a value for Meter Max based on Normal/Operating flow divided by 0.70 i.e Normal flow should be approx 70% of Meter Max.</p>",,,,,
SupportDiameter,"<p><b>Support Diameter</b> is the diameter across which the plate is supported. This is normally the same as the pipe I/D for Raised Face and Full Face flanges. For RTJ flanges with male rings, the ring PCD is used. These are automatically filled in. If no dimension is present or if a non-standard design is required, please enter the actual support diameter, confirm and clarify design.</p>",,,,,
ProductCode,<p>Select FPD180 orifice metering run</p>,,,,,
DPorBore,"<p>Select how to size the orifice, by <b>DP</b> (pressure drop) <i>or</i> <b>bore</b> (hole size).</p><p>If you select ""By DP"", you enter the meter max DP value, and the bore is then calculated.</p><p>If you select ""By Bore"", you enter the bore value and the DP value at Meter Max flow is calculated. The latter is useful for back-calculations or where the customer already has a bore size.</p>",,,,,
ResultsUnits,"<p>These units are used for the results display, calculation pages etc and may be amended as required.</p>",,,,,
CalculationType,<p><b>Calculation Type</b><br/>ISO 5167:2003 is the most common standard for Orifice Plates. Other standards exist and some are listed here. Please select ISO5167:2003 unless your customer requirements or data sheet specify otherwise.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/PRODUCT/DES,<p><b>Product Design</b><br/>Select the product variant required.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/CUST/STD,"<p><b>Design Standard</b><br/>Unless you require one of the other customer standards stated here, please select ABB Standard as this will comply with the design code selected above.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/ORIFICE/DESIGN,<p><b>Orifice Design</b><br/>Select the design variant required. Below 50 mm I/D corner tappings should be used to ISO TR 15377. Flange taps are the standard above 50 mm but are not the only option. The most common selection is Concentric Square Edge (CSE). Select other plate designs as required should Error Messages so advise.</p>,,,,,

CH/FPD/ELEM/MAT,"<p><b>Orifice Plate Material</b><br/>Please select correct orifice plate material required. If your material is not included in the pull-down list, please select ""Others"" and advise material detail in notes.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/PLATE/THICK,"<p><b>Orifice Plate Thickness</b><br/>ABB Standard plate thicknesses are:-<br/>6""NB (150mm) and below: 3mm<br/>8""NB (200mm) to 12""NB (300mm): 6mm<br/>14""NB (350mm) to 24""NB (600mm): 10mm<br/>For sizes above 24""NB (600mm), plate thickness is subject to a thickness calculation and metric plate thickness availability.</p><p>All thicknesses are subject to a minimum thickness calculation.</p> ",,,,,

CH/FPD/GASKET,<p><b>Gasket Material</b></p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAB/HANDLE,"<p><b>Tab Handle</b><br/>ABB Orifice Plates typically have a Tab Handle where the Tag Number, Pipe Size, Bore Size and other info are inscribed. If the customer specifically does <b>not</b> want a handle, select this option.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/ORI/SEALING/FACE,"<p><b>Orifice Sealing Face</b><br/>ABB standard plate finish is Ra &lt;= 0.8 um. If customer requests a scrolled (Ra 3.2 to 6.3 um) gasket contact area finish, then please select this option, but <b>only</b> if specifically required by the customer.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/DRAIN/VENT,"<p><b>Drain/Vent Hole</b><br/>Customers may request a drain or vent hole, where a drain hole is used for gases and steam so that moisture does not build up in bottom of pipe and a vent hole is used on liquid applications to prevent gas bubbles from building up in the top of the pipe. If this option is selected, then the size must be specified in the next option.</p><p><b>Note:</b> ISO 5167 states that drain or vent holes are not required for applications where the pipe inside diameter is less than 100mm.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/DRAIN/VENT/SIZE,<p><b>Drain/Vent Hole Size</b><br/>Required if drain/vent hole selected as this affects the DP calculated. <b>Note:</b> ISO 5167 states that drain or vent hole size should not exceed 10% of the bore diameter.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/SURFACE/TREAT,<p><b>Surface Treatment</b><br/>For applications which require complete removal of all traces of grease for safe operation e.g. oxygen service.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/CERTIFICATION,<p><b>Certification</b><br/>Standard is usually 3.1 Material Certification. Only select 3.2 material certificates if <b>specifically</b> requested. For sour gas NACE is usually selected. Please select all that apply to meet the customer specifications.</p>,,,,,
