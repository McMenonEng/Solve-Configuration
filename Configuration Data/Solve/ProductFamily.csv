It does not rely on a sharp edge (which can degrade over time) for maintaining its accuracy and therefore offers excellent long-term accuracy with less wear and reduced possibility of distortion. It is often used for flow testing on steam-raising plants. </p><p>A flow nozzle can measure higher flow rates than an equivalent orifice plate at the same design differential pressure.
