Fluid,<p>Select <b>Fluid</b> to be used from the list. &lt;Other&gt; allows you to enter your own density etc.</p>,,,,,
Quantity,<p><b>Quantity</b> of this part required.</p>,,,,,
Pressure,<p>Operating <b>pressure</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating pressure should be used here but the design pressure (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable pressure for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignPressure,<p><b>Design Pressure</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Temperature,<p>Operating <b>temperature</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating temperature should be used here but the design temperature (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable temperature for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignTemperature,<p><b>Design Temperature</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Density,"<p>For <b>fluids</b> that this application is programmed for, the <b><i>density</i></b> will be automatically computed from temperature and pressure.</p><p>For user defined fluids the <b><i>operating density</i>, <i>SG</i> or <i>MW </i></b> must be entered.</p>",,,,,
Viscosity,<p>Operating <b>viscosity</b> of a fluid is effectively a measure of its resistance to flow.</p>,,,,,
ZFactor,"<p><b>Z Factor</b> (compressibility) is required for gases only.</p><p>Selecting user gas means the Z Factor must be entered.</p><p>Z Factor is used to modify the ideal gas law to account for real gas behaviour.</p><p>The effect of Z Factor depends upon the units used for density and flow; please see the Tools menu, Z Factor Effects entry for a fuller explanation of this (ensure you have selected your required units first).</p><p>In the specific case of operating density and actual flow, Z Factor has no effect on the DP result calculated but is useful for converting to normal units.</p>",,,,,
IsentropicIndex,"<p><b>Isentropic Index</b></br>Also known as the heat capacity ratio, it is the ratio between the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) i.e. Cp/Cv</p>",,,,,
Dimensions,"<p><b>Pipe dimensions</b> are required; enter the relevant dimensions, or click on the Pipe NB button to bring up the pipe schedule wizard.</p><p>Actual dimensions <b>must</b> be used to ensure accurate calculations and correct installation.</p>",,,,,
FlowRates,"<p><b>Meter Max Flowrate</b> is always required. However, it is strongly advised to also enter values for ""Max Flow"", ""Normal Flow"", and, ""Minimum Flow"" if available.</p><p>Meter Max is the value to which the transmitter will be ranged (i.e. 20 mA). If Meter Max is not available, calculate a value for Meter Max based on Normal/Operating flow divided by 0.70 i.e Normal flow should be approx 70% of Meter Max.</p>",,,,,
HDRatio,"<p>Select the <b>H/D Ratio</b> for the element.<br/>The H/D is the ratio of the gap between the wedge and the pipe, and the inside diameter of the pipe. A small H/D ratio (a <b>large</b> wedge) will produce a larger DP; a large H/D (a <b>small</b> wedge) will produce a smaller DP.</p>",,,,,
ResultsUnits,"<p>These units are used for the results display, calculation pages etc and may be amended as required.</p>",,,,,
ProductCode,<p><b>Pipe Tap</b><br/>Wedge meter with small bore (typically ½ in.) taps in either the flange rim (sizes < 6 in.) or in the pipe (sizes > 4 in.).</p><p><b>Flange Tap</b><br/>Wedge meter with full bore flange connections (2 in., 3 in., 4 in.). For small line sizes, impulse connections may be connected to meter via concentric reducers.</p><p><b>Chemical Tee</b><br/>Wedge meter with full bore 5 in. chemical tee for direct connection to a remote seal transmitter.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/PRODUCT/DES,<p><b>Product Design</b><br/>Select the product variant required. The Pipe Tap unit has conventional tappings. The Remote Seal unit will only operate with a remote seal-equipped transmitter (either wafer seals or chemical tee seals).</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/ORIFICE/DESIGN,<p><b>Wedge Design</b><br/>Select the design variant required. Currently only a meter with a single wedge element is supported.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/LINE/SIZE,<p>Line Nominal Bore</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/PIPE/SCH,<p>Pipe Schedule</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/NONELEM/MAT,"<p><b>Body Material</b><br/>Please select actual meter body material required. If your material is not included in the pull-down list, please select ""Others"" and advise material detail in notes.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/ELEM/MAT,"<p><b>Wedge element material</b><br/>Please select actual material required for the wedge restriction itself. If your material is not included in the pull-down list, please select ""Others"" and advise material detail in notes.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/HD/RATIO,"<p>Select the <b>H/D Ratio</b> for the element.<br/>The H/D is the ratio of the gap between the wedge and the pipe, and the inside diameter of the pipe. A small H/D ratio (a <b>large</b> wedge) will produce a larger DP; a large H/D (a <b>small</b> wedge) will produce a smaller DP.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/END/CONN/TYPE,<p><b>Process Connection Type</b><br/>Select the required type of end connection.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/END/CONN/RAT,<p><b>Process Connection Rating</b><br/>Changing the pressure rating of the wedge potentially changes the design and cost of the meter.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAPPING/TYPE,<p><b>Tapping Type</b><br/>Select the type of tapping for connection to the transmitter. The flanged and chemical tee options are only available with remote seal wedges; the others are only available for pipe tap wedges.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAPPING/SIZE,<p><b>Tapping Size</b><br/>Select the size of tapping required. The larger sizes are only available with remote seal wedges.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAPPING/RAT,<p><b>Tapping Rating</b><br/>Please select the required pressure rating of the tappings. Note that Chemical tee taps are limited to a maximum of 20.6 Bar (300 lbf/in2).</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAPPING/SETS,<p><b>Number of Tapping Sets</b><br/>Select the number of sets of DP tappings required. One set is the standard selection; larger numbers may not be available on some versions and/or in smaller sizes.</p>  ,,,,,
CH/FPD/PIPE/ORIENT,<p><b>Pipe Orientation</b><br/>Select whether the pipe run at the meter is horizontal or vertical. Note that a vertical installation means that the two tappings are at different vertical heights and this will create an offset on the tapping pressures which may need to be corrected within the transmitter configuration.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/WELD/CODE,"<p><b>Welding Code</b><br/>The default welding code used is ""ASME B31.3 Normal Service"". If an alternative code is requested by the customer, select as required from the list. For a code that is not listed, please supply full details in the <b>Calculation Notes</b> box.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/SURFACE/TREAT,"<p><b>Surface Treatment</b><br/>As standard, no paint or other surface treatment is included. If required, select from the appropriate options. For ""Other"", please specify details of required coating/treatment in the <b>Calculation Notes</b> box. If a specific document covers the requirements, please attach it to the calculation file using the ""Import Documents"" feature within <b>Docs Actions</b>.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/CERTIFICATION,<p><b>Certification</b><br/>Standard is usually 3.1 Material Certification. Only select 3.2 material certificates if <b>specifically</b> requested. For sour gas NACE is usually selected. Please select all that apply to meet the customer specifications.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TESTING,"<p><b>Testing</b><br/>Only select if additional testing is required over and above the requirements of the standard material specification. If selected, full details must be provided in Calculation Notes box.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/CAL,"<p><b>Calibration</b><br/>All wedge meters are flow calibrated on water at 6 points as standard, but only in the ""forward"" flow direction. If a calibration in both directions - or anything other than the standard factory calibration - is required, please select the appropriate option here and also advise full details in the <b>Calculation Notes</b> box.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/DOC/LANG,<p><b>Documentation Language</b><br/>English manuals are standard and will be supplied if not advised otherwise. If another language is selected then please verify availability with factory.</p>,,,,,
