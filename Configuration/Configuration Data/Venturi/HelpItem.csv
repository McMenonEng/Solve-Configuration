Fluid,<p>Select <b>Fluid</b> to be used from the list. &lt;Other&gt; allows you to enter your own density etc.</p>,,,,,
Quantity,<p><b>Quantity</b> of this part required.</p>,,,,,
Pressure,<p>Operating <b>pressure</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating pressure should be used here but the design pressure (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable pressure for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignPressure,<p><b>Design Pressure</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Temperature,<p>Operating <b>temperature</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating temperature should be used here but the design temperature (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable temperature for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignTemperature,<p><b>Design Temperature</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Density,"<p>For <b>fluids</b> that this application is programmed for, the <b><i>density</i></b> will be automatically computed from temperature and pressure.</p><p>For user defined fluids the <b><i>operating density</i>, <i>SG</i> or <i>MW </i></b> must be entered.</p>",,,,,
Viscosity,<p>Operating <b>viscosity</b> of a fluid is effectively a measure of its resistance to flow.</p>,,,,,
ZFactor,"<p><b>Z Factor</b> (compressibility) is required for gases only.</p><p>Selecting user gas means the Z Factor must be entered.</p><p>Z Factor is used to modify the ideal gas law to account for real gas behaviour.</p><p>The effect of Z Factor depends upon the units used for density and flow; please see the Tools menu, Z Factor Effects entry for a fuller explanation of this (ensure you have selected your required units first).</p><p>In the specific case of operating density and actual flow, Z Factor has no effect on the DP result calculated but is useful for converting to normal units.</p>",,,,,
IsentropicIndex,"<p><b>Isentropic Index</b><br/>Also known as the heat capacity ratio, it is the ratio between the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) i.e. Cp/Cv</p>",,,,,
FlowRates,"<p><b>Meter Max Flowrate</b> is always required. However, it is strongly advised to also enter values for ""Max Flow"", ""Normal Flow"", and, ""Minimum Flow"" if available.</p><p>Meter Max is the value to which the transmitter will be ranged (i.e. 20 mA). If Meter Max is not available, calculate a value for Meter Max based on Normal/Operating flow divided by 0.70 i.e Normal flow should be approx 70% of Meter Max.</p>",,,,,
DPorBore,"<p>Select how to size the Venturi tube - by <b>DP</b> (pressure drop) <i>or</i> <b>bore</b> (hole size).</p><p>If you select ""By DP"", you enter the meter max DP value and the throat bore is then calculated.</p><p>If you select ""By Bore"", you enter the bore value and the DP value at Meter Max flow is calculated. The latter is useful for back-calculations or where the customer already has a bore size.</p>",,,,,
ResultsUnits,"<p>These units are used for the results display, calculation pages etc and may be amended as required.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/CAL,"<p><b>Calibration</b> is not usually performed on Venturi tubes. However if you do require calibration, but to no special standard, select <b>Standard Water Calibration</b>. If you require calibration by a third party, or to a specific standard, then select <b>Special Calibration</b>.</p>",,,,,
Dimensions,<p>The <b>Pipe Size</b> available to you depends upon the type of Venturi tube selected. A <b>Machined Venturi</b> is only available in pipe sizes up to 10 inch (250mm). A <b>Fabricated Venturi</b> is only available in pipe sizes from 12 inch (300mm) upwards.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/PRODUCT/DES,<p>The <b>Venturi Type</b> affects the pipe sizes available to you. A <b>Machined Venturi</b> is only available in pipe sizes up to 10 inch (250mm). A <b>Fabricated Venturi</b> is only available in pipe sizes from 12 inch (300mm) upwards.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/CUST/STD,"<p>The <b>Divergent Angle</b> affects the permanent pressure loss that the Venturi tube creates. Most tubes are <b>Classical</b>, which have a 15 degree angle on the outlet cone and a moderately low overall pressure loss. The <b>Long Pattern</b> design has a 7 degree angle on the outlet cone and is only occasionally requested. It results in a lower overall pressure loss. The <b>Bi-directional</b> design has both 10.5 degree entrance and exit angles and can be used to measure flow rate in both directions.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/ORIFICE/DESIGN,"<p>The <b>Tapping Method</b> relates to whether the DP measurements taken from each tap on the Venturi are:<br/>- measured directly, or<br/>- averaged together via an annular chamber</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/SURFACE/TREAT,<p><b>Surface Treatment</b><br/>For applications which require complete removal of all traces of grease for safe operation e.g. oxygen service.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/CERTIFICATION,<p><b>Certification</b><br/>ABB standard is usually 3.1 Material Certification. Only select 3.2 material certificates if <b>specifically</b> requested. For sour gas NACE is usually selected. Please select all that apply to meet the customer specifications.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TESTING,"<p><b>Testing</b><br/>Only select if additional testing is required over and above the requirements of the standard material specification. If selected, full details must be provided in Calculation Notes box.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/DOC/LANG,"<p><b>Documentation Language</b><br/>English manuals are standard and will be supplied if not advised otherwise.  If another language is selected, verify availability with factory</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/ADD/REQ,"<p><b>Added Requirements</b><br/>Advise (in Calculation Notes box) if there are any other requirements but note that full details are required. If ""Manufactured to customer drawing is selected"" please enter drawing reference number in box below and supply the drawing. If Material limitations are required please clarify full limits of the restrictions.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/END/CONN/TYPE,"<p><b>Flange Type</b><br/>Raised Face(RF), Flat/Full Face (FF) and Ring Type Joint (RTJ) are the flange facings offered.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/END/CONN/RAT,<p><b>Flange Rating</b><br/>The flange rating will affect the size and design of the Venturi.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAPPING,<p>Tapping</p>,,,,,
