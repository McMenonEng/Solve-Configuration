Fluid,<p>Select <b>Fluid</b> to be used from the list.  &lt;Other&gt; allows you to enter your own density etc. </p>,,,,,
Quantity,<p><b>Quantity</b> of this part required.</p>,,,,,
Pressure,<p>Operating <b>pressure</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating pressure should be used here but the design pressure (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable pressure for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignPressure,<p><b>Design Pressure</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Temperature,<p>Operating <b>temperature</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating temperature should be used here but the design temperature (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable temperature for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignTemperature,<p><b>Design Temperature</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Density,"<p>For <b>fluids</b> that this application is programmed for, the <b><i>density</i></b> will be automatically computed from temperature and pressure</p><p>For user defined fluids the <b><i>operating density</i>, <i>SG</i> or <i>MW </i></b> must be entered.</p>",,,,,
Viscosity,<p>Operating <b>viscosity</b> of a fluid is effectively a measure of its resistance to  flow. </p>,,,,,
ZFactor,"<p><b>Z Factor</b> (compressibility) is required for gases only.</p><p>Selecting user gas means the Z Factor must be entered.</p><p>Z Factor is used to modify the ideal gas law to account for real gas behaviour.</p><p>The effect of Z Factor depends upon the units used for density and flow; please see the Tools menu, Z Factor Effects entry for a fuller explanation of this (ensure you have selected your required units first).</p><p>In the specific case of operating density and actual flow Z Factor has no effect on the DP result calculated; but is useful for converting to normal units.</p>",,,,,
IsentropicIndex,"<p><b>Isentropic Index</b> Also known has the heat capacity ratio, and is the ratio between the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) i.e. Cp/Cv</p>",,,,,
Dimensions,"<p><b>Pipe dimensions</b> are required;  enter the relevant dimensions, or double click in Pipe NB to bring up the Pipe Schedule Wizard.</p> <p>Actual dimensions <b>must</b> be used to ensure accurate calculations and correct installation.</p>",,,,,
FlowRates,"<p><b>Meter Max Flowrate</b> is always required . However, it is strongly advised to also enter values for ""Max Flow"" ""Normal Flow"" ""Minimum Flow"" if available. </p><p>Meter Max is the value to which the transmitter will be ranged (i.e. 20 mA).  If Meter max is not available, calculate a value for Meter max based on Normal/Operating flow divided by 0.70 i.e Normal flow should be approx 70% of Meter Max.</p>",,,,,
SupportDiameter,"<p><b>Support Diameter</b> is the diameter across which the plate is supported.  This is normally the same as the pipe I/D for Raised Face and Full Face flanges.  For RTJ flanges with male rings,  the ring PCD is used. These are automatically filled in.  If no dimension is present or if a non-standard design is required, please enter the actual support diameter, confirm and clarify design</p>",,,,,
ProductCode,"<p>Select FPD150 orifice plate or FPD160  orifice flange assembly, as required</p>",,,,,
DPorBore,"<p>Select how to size the orifice, by <b>DP</b> (pressure drop) <i>or</i> <b>bore</b> (hole size)</p> <p>If you select ""By DP"", you enter the meter max DP value, and the bore is then calculated .</p><p>If you select ""By Bore"", you enter the bore value and the DP value at Meter Max flow is calculated. The latter is useful for back-calculations or where the customer already has a bore size.</p>",,,,,
ResultsUnits,"<p>These units are used for the results display, calculation pages etc and may be amended as required.</p>",,,,,
CalculationType,<p><b>Calculation Type</b><br/>ISO 5167:2003 is the most common standard for Orifice Plates. Other standards exist and some are listed here.  Please select ISO5167:2003 unless your customer requirements or data sheet specify otherwise. </p>,,,,,

CH/FPD/ORIFICE/DESIGN,<p><b>Orifice Design</b><br/>Select the design variant required.  Below 50mm i/d corner tappings should be used to ISO TR 15377. Flange taps are the standard above 50mm but are not the only option.   The most common selection is Concentric Square Edge (CSE).  Select other plate designs as required should Error Messages so advise.</p>,,,,,

CH/FPD/ELEM/MAT,"<p><b>Element Material</b><br/>Please  select correct actual element material required. If your material is not included in the pull-down list, please select ""Others"" and advise material detail in notes</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/PLATE/THICK,"<p><b>Orifice Plate Thickness</b><br/>ABB Standard plate thicknesses are:-<br/>6""NB (150mm) and below: 3mm<br/>8""NB (200mm) to 12""NB (300mm): 6mm<br/>14""NB (350mm) to 24""NB (600mm): 10mm<br/>Above 24""NB(600mm) is subject to thickness calc and to the available standard metric plate thicknesses</p><p>All thickness are subject to minimum thickness calculation. These  comply with ISO 5167</p> ",,,,,
CH/FPD/END/CONN/TYPE,"<p><b>Flange Type</b><br/>Raised Face(RF), Flat Face/Full Face (FF) and Ring Type Joint (RTJ) are the flange facings offered. This information is required even if we do not supply the flanges. This is required to correctly design the orifice plate</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/END/CONN/RAT,<p><b>Flange Rating</b><br/>Changing the rating of the flange potentially changes the design and cost of the orifice plate</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAPPING,<p>Tapping</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/FLUID,<p>Fluid Type</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/GASKET,<p>Gasket material selection <b>must be made</b> for RTJ plates and for FPD160 Orifice Flanges.  It is not required if ABB is supplying only an  Orifice Plate for installation between RF/FF flanges.  </p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAB/HANDLE,"<p>Tab Handle -ABB Orifice Plates typically have a Tab Handle where the Tag Number, Pipe Size, Bore Size and other info are inscribed.  If the customer specifically does <b>not </b>want a handle, select this option</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/ORI/SEALING/FACE,"<p>Orifice Sealing Face - ABB standard plate finish is Ra&lt;=0.8 micrometers.  If customer requests a scrolled (Ra 3.2 to 6.3micrometers) gasket contact area finish , then  please select this option, but <b>only if specifically required by the customer</b></p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/DRAIN/VENT,"<p><b>Drain/Vent Hole</b><br/>Customers may request a Drain or Vent hole,  Drain hole for gases and steam so that moisture does not build up in bottom of pipe and likewise for liquid a vent hole may be specified to prevent gas bubbles from building up in the top of the pipe.  If this option is selected, then the size must be specified in the next option.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/DRAIN/VENT/SIZE,<p><b>Drain/Vent Hole Size</b><br/>Required if drain/Vent hole selected as this affects the DP calculated.  Please note ISO 5167 stated Drain or vent hole size should not exceed 10% of the bore and is not required for line inside diametes below 100mm</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/SURFACE/TREAT,<p><b>Surface Treatment</b><br/>If oxygen service or other fluids which require complete removal of all grease traces for safe operation.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/CERTIFICATION,<p><b>Certification</b><br/>ABB standard is usually 3.1 Material Certification.  Only select 3.2 mat certs if <b>specifically </b>requested. For Sour Gas NACE is usually selected.  Please select all that apply to meet customer specification</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TESTING,"<p><b>Testing</b><br/>Only select if additional testing is required over and above the requirements of the standard material specification,  If selected, full details must be provided  (in Calculation Notes box)</p>",,,,,
