CustomerData,<p><b>Customer data</b> appears on quotes and specification sheets.</p>,,,,,
Density,"<p>For <b>fluids</b> that this application is programmed for, the <b><i>density</i></b> will be automatically computed from temperature and pressure.</p><p>For user defined fluids the <b><i>operating density</i>, <i>SG</i> or <i>MW </i></b> must be entered.</p>",,,,,
DPRequired,"<p><b>DP required</b> The pressure drop required over the plate, DP = upstream pressure - downstream pressure </p>",,,,,
FlowRates,"<p><b>Meter Max Flowrate</b> is always required. However, it is strongly advised to also enter values for ""Max Flow"", ""Normal Flow"", and, ""Minimum Flow"" if available in order for the software to carry out a resonance check.</p><p>Meter Max is the value to which the transmitter will be ranged (i.e. 20 mA). If Meter Max is not available, calculate a value for Meter Max based on Normal/Operating flow divided by 0.70 i.e Normal flow should be approx 70% of Meter Max.</p>",,,,,
Fluid,<p>Select <b>Fluid</b> to be used from the list. &lt;Other&gt; allows you to enter your own density etc.</p>,,,,,
FluidCategory,<p>Three different computation types are supported; dependent upon the fluid selected.</p> <p>See Technical Data Sheet for details of flow equations.</p>,,,,,
GasPropertyFactor,<p><b>Gas property factor</b> provides the noise computations with a magnitude adjustment for the gas or vapour in question.  For gases this can be computed from M.W. or entered manually using the override facility; for vapour (mass flow) please provide this value.</p>,,,,,
IsentropicIndex,"<p><b>Isentropic Index</b> Also known as the heat capacity ratio, and is the ratio between the heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and the heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) i.e. Cp/Cv. Not required for computation.</p>",,,,,
PipeFittingsMaterial,"<p><b>Pipe Fitting Material</b><br/>Please select correct actual pipe material required. If your material is not included in the pull-down list, please select ""Others"" and advise material detail in notes.</p>",,,,,
Pressure,<p>Operating <b>pressure</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating pressure should be used here but the design pressure should be checked against the maximum allowable pressure for the chosen %Product% model.</p>,,,,,
Quantity,<p><b>Quantity</b> of this part required.</p>,,,,,
ResultsUnits,"<p>These units are used for the results display, calculation pages etc and may be amended as required.</p>",,,,,
DesignPressure,<p><b>Design Pressure</b>: this allows you to specify a design pressure for the calculation of minimum plate thickness.</p>,,,,,
Temperature,<p>Operating <b>temperature</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating temperature should be used here but the design temperature should be checked against the maximum allowable temperature for the chosen %Product% model.</p>,,,,,
Viscosity,<p>Operating <b>viscosity</b> is <i>not</i> required for computations but is used to check whether %Product% is suitable (for cP or Poise only).</p>,,,,,
ZFactor,"<p><b>Z Factor</b> (compressibility) is required for gases only.</p><p>Selecting user gas means the Z Factor must be entered.</p><p>Z Factor is used to modify the ideal gas law to account for real gas behaviour.</p><p>The effect of Z Factor depends upon the units used for density and flow; please see the Tools menu, Z Factor Effects entry for a fuller explanation of this (ensure you have selected your required units first).</p><p>In the specific case of operating density and actual flow Z Factor has no effect on the DP result calculated; but is useful for converting to normal units.</p><p>For stack applications, a Z Factor of 1 may be used to obtain an estimation of DP.</p>",,,,,
DesignTemperature,<p><b>Design temperature</b> is the maximum temperature the wetted parts may be exposed to.</p>,,,,,
Particulates,<p>Maximum concentration of <b>particulate</b> that may be present in the flow. This will define if purge functionality is required.</p>,,,,,
Contaminants,<p>Material choice of wetted parts will be affected by presence of <b>corrosive components</b> in the flow.</p>,,,,,
HumidityPercent,"<p><b>Relative humidity (%)</b> of the gas. Calculations are corrected for the amount of water vapour in the fluid. Select ""Applies"" to enter the RH information.</p>",,,,,
StackCalcDesign,<p>FPD581 - Torbar (measuring probe) with optional transmitter</p><p>FPD583 - Torbar (measuring probe) with transmitter and manual enclosure for MCERTS</p><p>FPD585 - Torbar (measuring probe) with transmitter and automatic enclosure for purging and/or accuracy checks</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD58/INTERFACE/HEATER,<p>Please select heater if the ambient temperature will fall below -10°C (14°F).</p>,,,,,
Dimension_ID,"<p><b>Stack internal diameter</b> is the diameter the flow passes through - this does not include any refractory lining or similar.<br/>This is used to calculate volumetric flow and velocity, so it must be accurate to ensure correct calculation. Where possible, use a laser measurement tool to measure accurately.<br/>For rectangular ducts, dimension X is the section across which the probe will be inserted.</p>",,,,,
Dimension_WT,<p><b>Stack wall thickness</b> is the wall thickness of the stack including any refractory lining or cavity in between the stack skins.<br/>This is used to ensure the probe has the correct geometry for the installation.</p>,,,,,
Dimension_SO,"<p>Standard <b>Flange standoff length</b>for the various Flange sizes and ratings: </p>DN 40 (1½""); 150lb RF: 95 mm<br />DN 50 (2""); 150lb RF: 102 mm<br />DN 80 (3""); 150lb RF: 118 mm<br />DN 100 (4""); 150lb RF: 150 mm<br />DN 150 (6""); 150lb RF: 150 mm<br />DN 40 (1½""); PN 10 RF: 78 mm<br />DN 50 (2""); PN 10 RF: 86 mm<br />DN 80 (3""); PN 10 RF: 98 mm<br />DN 100 (4""); PN 10 RF: 150 mm<br />DN 150 (6""); PN 10 RF: 150 mm<br />",,,,,
Dimension_A,"<p>This is the length available to retract the probe safely and provide with safe access for installation. If this is reduced by lack of platform or a wind-shield, please inform us here as it will change the design of the probe.</p>",,,,,
Dimension_L,<p><b>Installation point</b> should be situated <b>at least 8D downstream</b> of any significant change in stack profile.</p>,,,,,
