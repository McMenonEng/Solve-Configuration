Fluid,<p>Select <b>Fluid</b> to be used from the list. &lt;Other&gt; allows you to enter your own density etc.</p>,,,,,
Quantity,<p><b>Quantity</b> of this part required.</p>,,,,,
Pressure,<p>Operating <b>pressure</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating pressure should be used here but the design pressure (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable pressure for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignPressure,<p><b>Design Pressure</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Temperature,<p>Operating <b>temperature</b> is required to compute results.</p><p><b>Note</b>: the operating temperature should be used here but the design temperature (if available) should be checked against the maximum allowable temperature for the chosen %APPLICATIONNAME% model.</p>,,,,,
DesignTemperature,<p><b>Design Temperature</b>: for information only - no calculations are performed using this value.</p>,,,,,
Density,"<p>For <b>fluids</b> that this application is programmed for, the <b><i>density</i></b> will be automatically computed from temperature and pressure.</p><p>For user defined fluids the <b><i>operating density</i>, <i>SG</i> or <i>MW </i></b> must be entered.</p>",,,,,
Viscosity,<p>Operating <b>viscosity</b> of a fluid is effectively a measure of its resistance to flow.</p>,,,,,
ZFactor,"<p><b>Z Factor</b> (compressibility) is required for gases only.</p><p>Selecting user gas means the Z Factor must be entered.</p><p>Z Factor is used to modify the ideal gas law to account for real gas behaviour.</p><p>The effect of Z Factor depends upon the units used for density and flow; please see the Tools menu, Z Factor Effects entry for a fuller explanation of this (ensure you have selected your required units first).</p><p>In the specific case of operating density and actual flow, Z Factor has no effect on the DP result calculated but is useful for converting to normal units.</p>",,,,,
IsentropicIndex,"<p><b>Isentropic Index</b></br>Also known as the heat capacity ratio, it is the ratio between the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) i.e. Cp/Cv</p>",,,,,
Dimensions,"<p><b>Pipe dimensions</b> are required; enter the relevant dimensions, or click on the Pipe NB button to bring up the pipe schedule wizard.</p><p>Actual dimensions <b>must</b> be used to ensure accurate calculations and correct installation.</p>",,,,,
FlowRates,"<p><b>Meter Max Flowrate</b> is always required. However, it is strongly advised to also enter values for ""Max Flow"", ""Normal Flow"", and, ""Minimum Flow"" if available.</p><p>Meter Max is the value to which the transmitter will be ranged (i.e. 20 mA). If Meter Max is not available, calculate a value for Meter Max based on Normal/Operating flow divided by 0.70 i.e Normal flow should be approx 70% of Meter Max.</p>",,,,,

CH/FPD/ELEM/MAT,"<p><b>Torbar Material</b><br/>Please select correct material required for the Torbar probe. If your material is not included in the pull-down list, please select ""Others"" and advise the material detail in the notes section.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/MOUNTING,<p><b>Mounting Type</b><br/>This is the means by which the Torbar is connected to the process pipe.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/END/CONN/TYPE,<p><b>Process Connection</b><br/>This option provides more detail about the flange or thread used in mounting the Torbar to the pipe.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/END/CONN/RAT,<p>Select the Flange Rating (or Not Flanged if a threaded unit has been selected).</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAPPING/TYPE,"<p><b>Tapping Type</b><br/>This details the type of connections available on the head of the Torbar for the customer to connect to. Options D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5 are concerned with mounting a transmitter directly to the probe.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/TAPPING/SIZE,<p>Select the size of tapping/valve required.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/VALVE/MAT,<p>Select the material required for the valve (or tapping).</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/PIPE/ORIENT,<p>Select the pipe orientation at the point of measurement and whether the pipe is circular or rectangular.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/ISO/VALVE,"<p>Select the size, type and material of any process isolation valve fitted (usually only an option on retractable models).</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/TORBAR/DES,<p>Select any options required from the available list.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TAPPING/SETS,"<p>Select the number of sets of DP connections required. Default is 1 set, for which no selection here is necessary.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/BOLT/TYPE/MAT,"<p>Select the material of the nuts and bolts. The materials appear in the order ""Bolt material / Nut material"".</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/GASKET,<p>Select the type of the gaskets.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/FITT/ACC,<p>Select any accessories that may be required.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/SURFACE/TREAT,<p>Select from the list any special product treatments that are required.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/CERTIFICATION,<p><b>Certification</b><br/>ABB standard is usually 3.1 Material Certification. Only select 3.2 material certificates if <b>specifically</b> requested. For sour gas NACE is usually selected. Please select all that apply to meet the customer specifications.</p>,,,,,
CH/FPD/TESTING,"<p><b>Testing</b><br/>Only select if additional testing is required over and above the requirements of the standard material specification. If selected, full details must be provided in Calculation Notes box.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/DOC/LANG,"<p><b>Documentation Language</b><br/>English manuals are standard and will be supplied if not advised otherwise. If another language is selected, verify availability with factory.</p>",,,,,
CH/FPD/ADD/REQ,<p><b>Added Requirements</b><br/>Advise (in Calculation Notes box) if there are any other requirements but note that full details are required. If Material limitations are required please clarify full limits of the restrictions.</p>,,,,,
KFactor,<p>This is the meter factor for the chosen meter type and size. It is not adjustable.</p>,,,,,
IsoValveLength,"<p>This is the length of the chosen type and size of isolation valve. It should not be over-ridden unless it has been agreed with the factory that a special valve will be supplied, or alternatively that the customer is supplying the isolation valve. If over-ridden, the coding will revert to <b>VF9: Valve supplied by customer</b> and the only other valid selection would be <b>VZ9: Others</b><br/>. Use <b>VZ9</b><br/> when the factory is supplying a special valve; use <b>VF9</b><br/> if the customer is supplying their own isolation valve; in both cases enter the appropriate valve length.</p>",,,,,
StandoffLength,<p>This is the length of the chosen type and size of flanged stand-off. It should not be over-ridden unless the customer is supplying the stand-off or if a special stand-off extension has been agreed.</p>,,,,,
